# TabletLoadBalancer
Java "tablet" load balancer. This project uses a generic Tablet object to represent an entity that manages some arbitrary number of keyed elements where each Tablet can be loaded on a server. These distributed servers can host one or more Tablet (although servers can technically host none that is assumed to be a wasteful state).

This is a sample project to evaluate different portions of Java development.
